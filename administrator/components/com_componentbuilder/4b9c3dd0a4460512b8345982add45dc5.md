> We would like to stay true to opensource mandate and have funding to improve JCB

## How will this be done?

We have added a number of features to JCB that allows us to extend it via Joomla Plugins. This we have done, so we can make separation between the core of JCB and it's add-ons. So it was decided that all new plugins that extend JCB with new and exciting features will first be made available to members who are in a yearly subscription called **[JCB Pro Membership](https://vdm.bz/get-jcb-pro-membership)**. We hope to release new-features more frequently due to this funding.

Only one year later after the release of a feature to the [JCB Pro Members](https://vdm.bz/get-jcb-pro-membership) will that feature be made public to the rest of the community.
